# Rocket Stove Plancha

This is a rocket stove plancha that I built for a wood fired bbq.

## Why and how did this start?

I love to prepare and eat a relaxed BBQ in the summer, and for a while I had a nice propane-fired barbecue.
However, some parts became rusty and needed repair or replacement, and then the war in Ukraine started. 
I became afraid of shortages and dependance on foreign energy imports.
Some of my energy consumption was already optimized - back then, an electric vehicle had been ordered, I've been heating the house with wood pellets, but I was still buying propane.
Meanwhile, propane more than doubled in price and this got me thinking.

Idealized thinking: Wouldn't it be nice to prepare food just from locally sourced wood?

Options I tried and rejected:
- fire pit / bowl: Sure - you can make a fire in a fire pit or in a fire bowl. This requires a large amount of wood, my cheap fire bowl does not have a permanent place and burns a hole in the lawn.
While uncomfortably cooking on the ground with a long handle, you will be smoked. With stronger winds this is sometimes not possible.

- luna fire ring: There is a beautiful swiss-made design fire bowl available, with a wide border for making BBQ on. Those things are massive and you need to design the garden around them. Due to the amount of steel, this requires quite some time before you can start cooking. Still, you are cooking on the ground with smoke in your eyes.   https://www.feuerring.ch/mein-feuerring

- fire barrel: Some neighbours have a fire barrel where they light a fire within. They are used for outside winter parties, have a table on top and provide some heat when standing around. In the center there is a chimney which takes care of the smoke. These barrels can get red-hot, they still burn the grass around them and consume a lot of wood. Although they get hot, there is no cooking option. Due to the sideways-radiated heat, you wouldn't want to heat them in summer.
  
- charcoal BBQ: maybe possible, but I'm not going to make charcoal myself. I don't like to stand in in the smoke of a reqular bbq.

## How? Rocket Mass Heaters / Rocket Stoves

In the community of permaculture, there is a well known concept of [rocket mass heaters](https://www.permaculturenews.org/2016/08/15/rocket-mass-heater-builders-guide/) and rocket stoves. 
Making wood burn efficiently seems to be a matter of burn chamber geometry only - this is not terribly complex and possible with almost any material.
I bought a ["BBQ Toro rocket stove #6"](https://www.bbq-toro.de/holzkohlegrills/raketenoefen/68986556/bbq-toro-raketenofen-rakete-6-rocket-stove-aus-1-5-mm-dickem-stahl) - but I was disappointed. Sure - you can make a fire and try cooking on the ground. But this thing gets hot all over the place and is neither efficient nor "rockety". It needs to be larger, insulated and more powerful!

The barrel-part of a rocket mass heater however seems to be a good size.

## Construction

Principle:
The burn chamber and heat riser are a j tube design, located mostly within the barrel (brown). 2mm steel pipe with 150mm dia (blue) is used throughout the system. 
Firewood is inserted from the right and there is fire only within the inner burn tube and heat riser.
The heat riser tube ends 5-10cm before the plancha cooking plate (dark blue) and hot gas will heat the center of the cooking plate.
The burnt gases then sink along the barrel and exit via the chimney from the bottom.
The long chimney gives a nice draft and pulls away the smoke when the system is not yet at operating temperature.
The burn chamber and heat riser as well as the bottom of the barrel are insulated (green).
Pipes are attached to the barrel via threaded rod and metal pipe clamps.
The plancha steel plate (dark blue) simply rests on the upper opening of the barrel.

Materials:
- a regular "oil" barrel (200l, 88cm high, 55cm diameter) that once contained an industrial lubricant. As the food will not come in contact with the inside, contaminations were not an issue.
- the cooking surface is a single 5mm round steel plate with 80cm diameter (without a hole in the middle!). It was 109€ from [kaufland.de](https://www.kaufland.de/product/372854474/) including shipping.
- all piping for burn chamber and chimney is 150mm chimney pipe (2mm material thickness), about 120€ of material from ofen.de, e.g. this [piece of pipe](https://www.ofen.de/ofenrohr-dn-150-mm-laenge-750-mm-schwarz), only the heat riser needed to be cut to length.
- threaded rods and nuts, metal pipe clamps for 150mm diameter (with the rubber removed)
- internal insulation with high temperature silica wool and fixed with stainless steel zip ties
- angle brackets and some wood for a small table


Tools:
- a jigsaw with metal blade
- a drill

Transportation: the upper chimney and the plancha steel cooking plate can be lifted off. Then there are two handles for carrying the barrel with two persons.
The T piece for inserting firewood can be removed for cleaning.




## Results

This thing works quite well and gives different zones of heat for preparing food.

Preparation and cleaning:
- I fire up with small wood, typically the draft starts after mere seconds. Initial smoke clears after a few minutes, after 10 minutes the plancha is hot.
- for cleaning (before and after), I usually heat it up, use oil and scrape off / wipe off the excess. Stainless grill spatulas work fine for cleaning and cooking
- once cooled, a small amount of ash can be taken out with a brush/shovel

Operation: 
- this has a surprisingly low fuel consumption, about two handfuls of split wood are sufficient for a full meal. The wooks needs to be splitt smaller than for a typical wood fired ofen.
- the fuel and fire ideally burns in the middle of the burn chamber. I try not to push it all the way to the back. If the fire burns in the j-tube downdraft or in the piece of pipe that sticks out, then the outside of this tube will get got. 
- the amount of heat is regulated by the amount of fuel (and not by adjusting air). If you are done searing the meat, half full is sufficient for vegetables.
- the outside of the barrel will also get somewhat hot, but not red-hot and the paint has not burnt off.
- I can't measure the max. temperature, but you can easily evaporate cooking oil if you keep heating too much.

Safetey:
- due to insulation on the bottom inside, the bottom of the barrel barely gets warm. It works well on a wooden terrace without burn marks. I still put it on a few bricks to raise the working height a little.
- the part of the burn chamber/loading port that sticks out can get quite hot. I added a T-piece of pipe so that no burning material can fall out easily. Below this pipe is another brick to pretect the terrace from the heat and that you first bump you foot on the stone instead of the hot pipe.
- it burns well even in strong wind, there is no sparks flying and I often leave the fire unattended for a while
